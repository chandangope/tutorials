__*lstm_waveforms_classification.ipynb*__

A __Recurrent Neural Network__ tutorial.
In particular, a *very simple* __LSTM__ implementation tutorial using __TensorFlow__ library.
We demonstrate sequence recognition problem with 1-dimensional data (square-wave vs sine-wave)

The goals of this tutorial are:
* To keep code as simple as possible, so that its useful for beginners in Tensorflow/RNN
* To focus on the basic ideas, and not necessarily the best practices in coding
* No dependency on any external data source, this tutorial generates the data for you
* To help developers apply some of the ideas presented here, to their own real-world applications
